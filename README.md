# 🐍 Python Practice

Welcome to my **Python Practice** repo — a sandbox of scripts, experiments, and mini-projects as I explore and improve my coding skills. This is where I rewrite, remix, and learn from existing code while building my own understanding of Python.

## 📁 What's Inside

This repo includes a variety of Python files covering:

- 🎮 Simple games (e.g. Snake, Math Quiz)
- 🔢 Algorithms and logic puzzles
- 🧪 Code rewrites from tutorials and challenges
- 🛠️ Utility scripts and experiments

Each file is standalone and may include personal tweaks or comments to explain what I learned.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

I'm using this space to:
- Practice writing clean, readable code
- Reinforce core concepts like loops, functions, and data structures
- Explore Python libraries like `turtle`, `random`, and `time`
- Build confidence through repetition and experimentation

## 📌 Note

Some code is adapted from public challenges like **100+ Python Projects** or online tutorials. Credit is given where due, and all modifications are for educational purposes.
